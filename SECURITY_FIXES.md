# Security Vulnerability Fixes

This file documents the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in this commit.

## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### 1. **CRITICAL: User ID Update Vulnerability (CVE-like)**
**Location**: `server/api/users/[id].put.ts`
**Issue**: Users could potentially update their ID to an existing user's ID without proper validation
**Impact**: Account takeover, data corruption, broken referential integrity
**Fix**: Added uniqueness validation before allowing ID updates

### 2. **HIGH: CRON Secret Environment Variable Exposure**
**Location**: `server/utils/defineApi.ts`
**Issue**: Direct access to `process.env.CRON_SECRET` instead of runtime config
**Impact**: Potential environment variable exposure in client-side code
**Fix**: Moved CRON_SECRET to runtime config

### 3. **CRITICAL: Missing Import Causing Runtime Error**
**Location**: `server/api/shop-verification/index.post.ts`
**Issue**: Missing import for `extractItemId` function
**Impact**: Complete failure of shop verification endpoint
**Fix**: Added proper import statement

### 4. **MEDIUM: Subdomain Bypass in URL Validation**
**Location**: `shared/utils/extractItemId.ts`
**Issue**: `hostname.endsWith()` check could be bypassed by subdomain attacks
**Impact**: SSRF vulnerability through subdomain spoofing
**Fix**: Changed to exact hostname matching

### 5. **MEDIUM: Missing Error Handling**
**Location**: `app/components/modal/profileInitialize.vue`
**Issue**: No error handling for profile initialization API calls
**Impact**: Poor user experience and potential security issues
**Fix**: Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 6. **LOW: Enhanced XSS Protection**
**Location**: `server/utils/sanitizeObject.ts`
**Issue**: Sanitization could be more restrictive
**Impact**: Potential XSS vulnerabilities
**Fix**: Added additional security options to sanitization

### 7. **MEDIUM: Missing Rate Limiting**
**Location**: `server/api/shop-verification/index.post.ts`
**Issue**: No rate limiting for external API calls
**Impact**: Potential SSRF/DoS vulnerabilities
**Fix**: Added 5-minute cooldown between verification attempts

### 8. **HIGH: Missing Audit Logging**
**Location**: `server/api/users/[id].put.ts`
**Issue**: No audit trail for critical user ID changes
**Impact**: Lack of security monitoring and forensics
**Fix**: Added audit logging for user ID changes

## Security Improvements

- Added unique constraint validation for user ID updates
- Implemented proper transaction handling for user data changes  
- Enhanced URL validation to prevent subdomain bypass attacks
- Added rate limiting for external API calls
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced HTML sanitization rules
- Added comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations

## Testing

Created basic security test framework in `tests/security.test.js` that documents the test cases that should be implemented to validate these fixes.
